# Building a code generator

A code generator is a component that given an AST permits to generate code.

It can be a component inside a transpiler, or it can be used to define AST programmatically and then generate them.

This use case is currently being improved. At the moment we are doing experiments in projects such as StarLasu-Tools (to generate Kotlin and Python).
In the future more support is planned to be added in StarLasu itself.
