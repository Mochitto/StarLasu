# Building a parser

Building parsers has been the traditional use case. Kolasu has been created with this goal in mind and tens of commercial parsers has been 
implemented with it.

Our preferred approach is to initially use an ANTLR parser and then wrap it with StarLasu ASTs.

Process:

- The ANTLR parser is invoked. It returns a parse tree and a series of errors
- AST classes are defined using StarLasu. An initial version may also be generated by using StarLasu-Tools.
- [The parse tree is mapped into AST](https://github.com/Strumenta/StarLasu/blob/main/documentation/parsetree_to_ast.md)
- Potentially [symbol resolution](https://github.com/Strumenta/StarLasu/blob/main/documentation/symbol_resolution.md) is performed on the AST
- Potentially [type calculation](https://github.com/Strumenta/StarLasu/blob/main/documentation/typesystem.md) is performed on the AST

The StarLasu ASTs provides a more convenient API with respect to the ANTLR APIs for parse trees. They provide additional features like serialization 
or support for symbol resolution. Finally in the mapping process we clean the parse-tree, organize the information in the most convenient way for users.
