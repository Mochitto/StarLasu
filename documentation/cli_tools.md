StarLasu supports the definition of CLI tools for each parser. These CLI tools are intended for the parser users.

These tools permit to:

- Generate and serialize the AST in various formats
- Generate statistics

In addition to that, a series of tools for supporting parser developers. These are part of a separate (private) project named [StarLasu tools](https://github.com/Strumenta/starlasu-tools).
