# Testing

StarLasu offers support for comparing parse trees and ASTs.

See `assertParseTreeStr`, `assertParsingResultsAreEqual`, and `assertASTsAreEqual` in Kolasu.

Related to this, there is experimental support for verifying the Coverage of a grammar by the examples we have. See `CoverageListener` in Kolasu.
